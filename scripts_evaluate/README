             Stallmann, Brglez, Ghosh: Data Evaluation Scripts
                                      
   These scripts are in two categories. The first category takes raw data
   from directories containing the experimental subjects and summarizes
   the data. The raw data is in files created by the execution scripts,
   files named TR?? that record actual crossing numbers for each subject
   treated by treatment ?? or files named TIMING_TR?? that record time
   and number of iterations for the treatment in question. Each of these
   scripts has a single argument, which is a string called class-name
   denoting the set of subdirectories from which to gather data. In
   general this string will contain globbing information, such as
   GB_*_rnd0_0?, and needs to be put in quotes.
     * sbg_confidence_intervals - script to produce 95% confidence
       intervals for data in TR?? files in specified class directories;
       number of subjects can be set along with relevant t-table data
       Usage: sbg_confidence_intervals class-name
     * sbg_itr_summaries - script to generate summaries of iteration data
       from TIMING_TR?? files in specified class directories
       Usage: sbg_itr_summaries class-name
     * sbg_summaries to generate summaries from TR?? files in specified
       class directories (is careful to use the last 64 -- or whatever
       the appropriate class size -- data entries; there may be 65 in
       case of an isomorphic class, the first being biased because of the
       way it was generated.
       Usage: sbg_summaries class-name
     * sbg_summary2ci to generate confidence intervals from existing
       SUMMARY files; uses confidence.awk to process the data (can set
       the number of subjects).
       Usage: sbg_summary2ci class-name
     * sbg_timing_summaries - script to generate summaries from
       TIMING_TR?? files in specified class directories
       Usage: sbg_timing_summaries class-name
       
   The second type of script generates tabular data appropriate for use
   in a spreadsheet program. We used DeltaGraph, but others would work
   equally well.
   
   Most of these scripts require two treatments as input -- these are
   given on the command line in the form tr??, or dot in the special case
   of the dot treatment. Most also allow an additional argument, whose
   presence causes the minimum rather than the average to be used when
   looking at crossing number statistics for a class. The optional
   argument also causes either _scr or _min, as appropriate, to be added
   as a suffix to the output file name. When random classes are involved,
   the corresponding iso classes are used when the optional argument is
   present. The other scripts all require that sbg_summaries has already
   been executed for the relevant classes.
     * decomposition.awk - an awk program for creating the DeltaGraph
       input for the decomposition diagram representation of a particular
       bigraph class (for use with csh script sbg_decomposition)
     * edges_[bhrx] - files giving the number of edges for various sizes
       of butterflies, hypercubes, grids, and vlsi graphs, respectively
       (edges_x also gives the sizes used for all random graph classes,
       except those specifically based on communication graphs).
     * quotient.awk - transforms two fields to one as by taking their
       quotient (x if undefined, 1 in the special case of 0/0).
     * sbg_comm_ratios - creates a data file suitable for DeltaGraph,
       plotting ratios of crossing numbers between two treatments for
       butterflies, hypercubes, and grids
     * sbg_decomposition - creates DeltaGraph input for the decomposition
       diagrams representing a single size class (uses decomposition.awk)
       Usage: sbg_decomposition class [min]
     * sbg_graph_ratios - creates a data file suitable for DeltaGraph,
       plotting ratios of crossing numbers between two treatments for
       random graphs of various density factors.
     * sbg_tree_ratios - creates a data file suitable for DeltaGraph,
       plotting ratios of crossing numbers between two treatments for
       trees of various dimensions.
     * sbg_vlsi_ratios - creates a data file suitable for DeltaGraph,
       plotting ratios of crossing numbers between two treatments for all
       VLSI graphs.
