<h2 align=center>Stallmann, Brglez, Ghosh: Data Evaluation Scripts</h2>

These scripts are in two categories.
The first category takes raw data from directories containing the
experimental subjects and summarizes the data. The raw data is in files
created by the execution scripts, files named <code>TR??</code> that record
actual crossing numbers for each subject treated by treatment
<code>??</code> or files named <code>TIMING_TR??</code> that record time
and number of iterations for the treatment in question.
Each of these scripts has a single argument, which is a string called
<var>class-name</var> denoting the
set of subdirectories from which to gather data. In general this string
will contain globbing information, such as <code>GB_*_rnd0_0?</code>, and
needs to be put in quotes.

<ul>
<li><b><a href=sbg_confidence_intervals>sbg_confidence_intervals</a></b> -
	  script to produce 95% confidence intervals for data 
	  in TR?? files in specified class directories; number of subjects can
	  be set along with relevant t-table data
	  <br>
	  Usage: <code>sbg_confidence_intervals</code> <var>class-name</var>
	  <br>
<li><b><a href=sbg_itr_summaries>sbg_itr_summaries</a></b> - script to
	  generate summaries of iteration data from 
	  TIMING_TR?? files in specified class directories
	  <br>
	  Usage: <code>sbg_itr_summaries</code> <var>class-name</var>
	  <br>
<li><b><a href=sbg_summaries>sbg_summaries</a></b> to generate summaries
	  from TR?? files in specified class 
	  directories (is careful to use the last 64 -- or whatever
	  the appropriate class size -- data entries; there may be 65
	  in case of an isomorphic class, the first being biased
	  because of the way it was generated.
	  <br>
	  Usage: <code>sbg_summaries</code> <var>class-name</var>
	  <br>
<li><b><a href=sbg_summary2ci>sbg_summary2ci</a></b> to generate confidence
	  intervals from existing <code>SUMMARY</code> files; uses <a
	  href="confidence.awk"><code>confidence.awk</code></a> to process the
	  data (can set the number of subjects). 
	  <br>
	  Usage: <code>sbg_summary2ci</code> <var>class-name</var>
	  <br>
<li><b><a href=sbg_timing_summaries>sbg_timing_summaries</a></b>  - script
	  to generate summaries from TIMING_TR?? files
	  in specified class directories
<br>
	  Usage: <code>sbg_timing_summaries</code> <var>class-name</var>
	  <br>
</ul>

The second type of script generates tabular data appropriate for use in a
spreadsheet program. We used DeltaGraph, but others would work equally
well.

<p>
Most of these scripts
require two treatments as input -- these are given on the command line in
the form <code>tr??,</code> or <code>dot</code>
in the special case of the dot treatment. Most also
allow an additional argument, whose presence causes the minimum rather
than the average to be used when looking at crossing number statistics
for a class. The optional argument also causes either <code>_scr</code> or
<code>_min</code>, as
appropriate, to be added as a suffix to the output file name. When random
classes are involved, the corresponding iso classes are used when the
optional argument is present.  The other scripts all require that
sbg_summaries has already been executed for the relevant classes.

<ul>
<li><b><a href=decomposition.awk>decomposition.awk</a></b>  - an awk
	  program for creating the DeltaGraph input for 
	  the decomposition diagram representation of a particular bigraph
	  class (for use with csh script <code>sbg_decomposition</code>)
<li><b>edges_[bhrx]</b> - files giving the number of edges for various sizes
   of butterflies, hypercubes, grids, and vlsi graphs, respectively
   (edges_x also gives the sizes used for all random graph classes, except
   those specifically based on communication graphs).
<li><b><a href=quotient.awk>quotient.awk</a></b>  - transforms two fields
	  to one as by taking their quotient (x if undefined, 1 in the special
	  case of 0/0).
<li><b><a href=sbg_comm_ratios>sbg_comm_ratios</a></b> - creates a data
	  file suitable for DeltaGraph, plotting
	  ratios of crossing numbers between two treatments for
	  butterflies, hypercubes, and grids
<li><b><a href=sbg_decomposition>sbg_decomposition</a></b> - creates
	  DeltaGraph input for the decomposition diagrams
	  representing a single size class (uses <code>decomposition.awk</code>)
	  <br>
	  Usage: <code>sbg_decomposition</code> <var>class</var> [<code>min</code>]
	  <br>
<li><b><a href=sbg_graph_ratios>sbg_graph_ratios</a></b> - creates a data
	  file suitable for DeltaGraph, plotting 
	  ratios of crossing numbers between two treatments for
	  random graphs of various density factors.
<li><b><a href=sbg_tree_ratios>sbg_tree_ratios</a></b> - creates a data
	  file suitable for DeltaGraph, plotting 
	  ratios of crossing numbers between two treatments for
	  trees of various dimensions.
<li><b><a href=sbg_vlsi_ratios>sbg_vlsi_ratios</a></b> - creates a data
	  file suitable for DeltaGraph, plotting
	  ratios of crossing numbers between two treatments for
	  all VLSI graphs.
</ul>
