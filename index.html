<h4>
Modifications since version 1.2
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
       It is now possible to download and use the software for crossing
       minimization in standalone fashion, without all the experimental
       infrastructure.  To do this, simply download
       <a href="src/treatments.tar.gz">
       <code>src/treatments.tar.gz</code></a>, 
       unpack it and read the instructions on the index page
       <code>html/index.html</code>.
       The <code>treatments</code> directory now has a subdirectory called
       <code>Examples</code> with a set of small graph instances that can be
       tested to make sure the software is working properly.  A
       <a href="src/treatments/Examples/README.txt">README.txt</a> file
       explains further.
  <li>
       Reintroduced treatment 23 so that all experiments from the paper can
       be replicated (it was removed in versions 1.1 and 1.2 because it was
       inefficient and only gave significantly better results than treatment
       17 on random trees, where a minimum linear arrangement would give
       optimal solutions).
  <li>
       Cleaned up some of the code for treatments so that the control
       structure is more transparent.
  <li>
       Added GPL copyright information and doxygen documentation at the file
       level. The copyright statements on individual files do
       <strong>not</strong> supercede the ACM copyright below.
</ul>
<h4>Other modifications since original JEA version:
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Code has been updated to compile under gcc 4.0; includes of deprecated
    headers have been replaced (thanks to Ron de Bruijn, Utrecht University,
    The Netherlands, for pointing out the
    need for this).
  </li>
  <li>
  The <code>dot</code> software is no longer a part of this release (it
  does not compile under many newer gcc compilers).
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed an uninitialized pointer that caused problems on some platforms,
  particularly Linux
  (Special thanks to Waseem Ahmad, UIC, for pointing out the problem).
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>sbg_run_all</code> is now more verbose (tells you what it's doing
  so that the example is more transparent).
  </li>
</ul>

Separate files for main topics are accessible via links below. All
<code>README</code> files are generated from <code>.html</code> files
using

An <code>index.html</code> file generates a plain <code>README</code>
file. Any other <code>file.html</code> generates <code>README.file</code>.
The <code>README</code> (<code>.html</code>) files for the main topics are
