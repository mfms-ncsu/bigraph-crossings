To create the executable simply use gcc:
   gcc -lm scramble_dot.c -o scramble_dot

This program takes a reference dot file and generates scrambled
dot files along with order files. The files named
    <ref_graph>_scr_<4-digit-index>.dot
    <ref_graph>_scr_<4-digit-index>.dot.ORD

The order files are given the extension ORD so that other .ord files 
generated by the treatments can be distinguished from them.

The program needs a seed file containing three unsigned short integers
which are used as seed for the random number generator erand48. One
can repeat the same sequence of random number generation in this
method. We write out the starting seed (for each scrambled version)
in both the dot and ORD files (should a need arise to repeat the
scrambling process, may be with a larger no. of scrambled versions).
Note: the program will abort of the seed_file is not there. An example
seed_file is in the data directory.

The dot file outputs the edges based on (1) the order of layer 0
nodes, and, (2) for edges with same layer 0 node (same source node),
based on the order of the layer 1 nodes (sink nodes).
