               Source for Program to Generate Random Bigraphs
                                      
     * CmdLine.cxx - implementation of command-line parser
     * CmdLine.hxx - header for a class that parses the command line
       (uses classes StrQueue and StrTable)
     * Graph.cxx - implementation of Graph ADT
     * Graph.hxx - header for Graph ADT (used for generating random
       connected graphs but may have other applications later);
       undirected
     * IntIterator.cxx - based on recIterator.C in Perry/Levin, Section
       12.7
     * IntIterator.hxx - based on recIterator.H in Perry/Levin, Section
       12.7
     * IntList.cxx - based on recList.C in Perry/Levin, Section 12.7
     * IntList.hxx - based on recList.H in Perry/Levin, Section 12.7
     * IntNode.cxx based on recNode.C in Perry/Levin, Section 12.7
     * IntNode.hxx - based on recNode.H in Perry/Levin, Section 12.7
     * Rand.hxx - definition of a class of random number streams; each
       stream can be initialized from an istream or an array of 3 short
       int's and (optionally) written to an ostream via the overloaded
       operator. Uses rand48 library.
     * StrNode.cxx (from Perry/Levin, chapter 12)
     * StrNode.hxx (modified from strNode.H in Perry/Levin, chapter 12)
     * StrQueue.cxx (from Perry/Levin, chapter 12)
     * StrQueue.hxx (from Perry/Levin, chapter 12, uses class StrNode)
     * StrTabNode.cxx (modified from telNode.H in Perry/Levin, chapter
       12)
     * StrTabNode.hxx (modified from telNode.H in Perry/Levin, chapter
       12)
     * StrTable.cxx (a modified version of telDirectory.C from
       Perry/Levin, chapter 12)
     * StrTable.hxx (a modified version of telDirectory.H from
       Perry/Levin, chapter 12; uses class StrTabNode)
     * defs.h - definitions common to all source files for randomBiGraph
     * dot.cxx - functions that read "dot" format for graphs
     * dot.h - module for reading "dot" files
     * ord.cxx - implementation of utility functions that read and write
       .ord files (node ordering on layers of a graph)
     * ord.h - header for utility functions that read and write .ord
       files (node ordering on layers of a graph)
     * randomBiGraph.cxx - program to generate a random connected
       bipartite graph with a given number of nodes specified for each
       side and a given number of edges
     * Makefile for programs generating random bipartite graphs in .dot
       format
