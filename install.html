<h2 align=center>Stallmann, Brglez, Ghosh: Software Installation</h2>

<p>
The software in this package is known to run on Solaris 2.5 and 2.6 and on
Linux 2.4. A recent version of the gnu gcc/g++ compiler (2.8.1 or
later) is assumed.

<p>
Installation requires about 5MB of disk space, or 3MB for the
<code>bin</code> directory and 2MB for the rest. To run the example, you
need at least another 8MB in the data directory.

<p>
The <code>sbg_install</code> script does the actual installation -- usage is
<pre>
   sbg_install [ root_directory [ bin_directory ] ]
</pre>
where
<ul>
  <a name="root"></a>
  <li> <code>root_directory</code>
		 is where directories bin, data, various scripts, and src
		 will be installed as subdirectories (default, when there are no
		 arguments, is the current directory)
		 <a name="bin"></a>
  <li> <code>bin_directory</code> is where the binary executables will be
		 stored (default is the bin directory under root_directory)
</ul>

The script compiles all C and C++ programs, copies all executables into
the bin directory and all scripts into the appropriate subdirectories of
the root directory, creates the subdirectories data and processed, and
creates a seed file for random generation of data in the default location
(see <a href="scripts_generate">scripts_generate</a>)
based on the process id and the current
date and time.

<p>
After installation and before execution, you need to do one of the
following:
<ol>
  <li> Give the command
		 <pre>
         setenv PROGRAM_DIRECTORY bin_directory
		 </pre>
      or its Bourne shell equivalent
       <pre>
         export PROGRAM_DIRECTORY=bin_directory
       </pre>
      before running any of the scripts; the script then automatically
      incorporates <code>bin_directory</code> into the current path.

  <li> Put the command
		 <pre>
         setenv PATH "bin_directory:$PATH"
		 </pre>
		 into your <code>.cshrc</code>
		 file (or whatever the init file for your shell is).

  <li> If the directory you specified as your bin_directory is already part
		 of your default path, there is no need to do either of the above
		 (before making such a decision, be sure that there are no name
		 conflicts with existing programs -- our executables all have names
		 beginning with sbg_ so this should not be a problem).
</ol>
