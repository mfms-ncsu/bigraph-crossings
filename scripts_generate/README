             Stallmann, Brglez, Ghosh: Data Generation Scripts
                                      
   This directory contains class generation scripts for the paper
   "Heuristics, Experimental Subjects, and Treatment Evaluation in
   Bigraph Crossing Minimization", by M. Stallmann, F. Brglez, and D.
   Ghosh. 
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   These generation scripts require the presence of a seed file
   containing 3 non-negative integers < 2^16. These are used to construct
   the seed for Default name for the seed file is seed_file in the
   current directory, but may be changed by setting the environment
   variable SEED_FILE prior to running the script.
   
   Directories corresponding to the bigraph classes are installed in the
   directory ../data (wrt the current directory), but may be changed by
   setting the environment variable DATA_DIRECTORY.
   
   Finally, the binaries for various bigraph generating programs are
   assumed to be on the current path or in the directory specified by the
   environment variable PROGRAM_DIRECTORY.
   
   The scripts are as follows:
     * sbg_gen_[0-2][01]
       The script sbg_gen_xy creates all isomorphism classes for the
       graph type G[xy,k]. To create all the VLSI graphs, simply do (in
       csh)
     % foreach type ( 00 01 10 11 20 21 )
     foreach? sbg_gen_$type
          foreach? end 
          + sbg_gen_00
          + sbg_gen_01
          + sbg_gen_10
          + sbg_gen_11
          + sbg_gen_20
          + sbg_gen_21
          + sbg_gen_a1 - create random tree classes with same number of
            cell and net nodes and same number of edges as the G_{xy,k}
            graphs; dimensions range from 1 to 2.
          + sbg_gen_abd - generate random bigraphs of a specified type
            Usage: gen_abd [-a density] [-b balance] [-d dimension] [-x]
            [-r rank] [-N number of subjects]
            where
            density = # of edges / (# of nodes - 1) (default = 1)
            balance = # of side 1 nodes / # of side 0 nodes (1)
            dimension = 1 + e, where spanning tree is constructed using
            distance between points in a 1 x e rectangle if e is in the
            interval [0,1]; otherwise, spanning tree is based on
            uniformly random point-to-point distances (0)
            the -x option is present if graphs are not necessarily
            connected,
            rank = highest rank (rank 1 implies 20 edges; after that each
            rank doubles the number of edges and adds 10) (default = 8)
            number of subjects = number of subjects per class (default =
            32)
            At least one argument must be explicitly specified.
          + sbg_gen_bfly - create butterflies only
          + sbg_gen_bfly_rnd - create random graphs with the same
            signature as butterfly graphs
          + sbg_gen_grid - create grids (meshes) only
          + sbg_gen_grid_rnd gen_grid_rnd - create random graphs with the
            same signature as grids (meshes)
          + sbg_gen_hcube - create hypercubes only
          + sbg_gen_hcube_rnd - create random graphs with the same
            signature as hypercubes
          + sbg_gen_iso - script to create isomorphism classes from
            representatives of a specified collection of random classes
            Usage: sbg_gen_iso class-name [ individual ]
            where class-name is a string specifying a set of
            subdirectories of the data directory (enclosed in single or
            double quotes to prevent globbing) and individual is an
            integer specifying the particular representative of a class
            to use (default = 1); the class name of the new iso class has
            a suffix _scrindividual
          + sbg_gen_jm - create graphs corresponding to those reported in
            the Juenger and Mutzel paper (plus larger ones of the same
            type and connected graphs to match each class)
          + sbg_generate - generate a class of random bigraphs in which
            sizes increase by an exact factor of 2 (as opposed to the 2x
            + 10 increase used in the JEA paper. Arguments are the same
            as those used by sbg_gen_abd, except that the flags -L and -U
            are used to specify the smallest and largest number of edges,
            respectively. Defaults are 64 and 2048.
          + sbg_harvest_seeds - retrieve seed information used to
            generate the specified classes
            Usage: sbg_harvest_seeds class-name output-file
            where class-name is a string specifying a set of
            subdirectories of the data directory (enclosed in single or
            double quotes to prevent globbing) and output-file is where
            the class names and the seeds are stored.
