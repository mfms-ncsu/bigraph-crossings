<p>
Directories corresponding to the bigraph classes are assumed to be in the
directory <code>../data</code>
(wrt the current directory), but may be changed by
setting the environment variable <code>DATA_DIRECTORY.</code>

<p>
The binaries for various bigraph generating programs are assumed
to be on the current path or in the directory specified by the environment
variable <code>PROGRAM_DIRECTORY.</code>

<p>
All of these scripts have at least one argument specifying the bigraph
classes on which the treatments are to be executed (and all will print a
usage message if no arguments are supplied). This argument is either the
name of the subdirectory for a single class --
e.g. <code>GB_1_rnd2_08</code>
if the
treatments are to be run on the random bigraph class R(1,3830,2) (see
description of naming conventions in the top-level
<a href="../formats.html">README.formats</a>) -- or a quoted
expression for multiple classes using Unix "wild cards" --
e.g. <code>'GB_1_rnd*_0[1-8]'</code>
for all random tree classes (the quotes are
required to prevent premature shell expansion).
