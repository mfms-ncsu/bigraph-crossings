Stallmann, Brglez, Ghosh: Example Illustrating Use of Scripts</h2>

<p>
Suppose you wanted to recreate the test data, experiments, and organization
of results that led to Fig. 9(c) in the paper - ratio of tr03 and tr06 on
random trees. Further details on the scripts are provided in README (or
index)
files in the directories containing them:
<a href="scripts_generate">scripts_generate</a>,
<a href="scripts_execute">scripts_execute</a>,
and <a href="scripts_evaluate">scripts_evaluate</a>.

<p>
First make sure that you've taken one of the post-installation
suggestions to put all our binaries into your path when needed. For
example, you might say (if you're in the top-level directory and your
binaries are installed in the bin subdirectory)

<pre>
   setenv PROGRAM_DIRECTORY $cwd/bin
</pre>

Then generate the data. Go into the <code>scripts_generate</code>
directory and run either

<pre>
   ./sbg_gen_a1            # generate all random bigraphs with a = 1
</pre>

(this has been edited so that ranks 6, 7, and 8 are not generated since
these would take too long) or

<pre>
   ./sbg_gen_abd -d 1 # generate all random bigraphs with a = 1 (default), d = 1
   ./sbg_gen_abd -d 1.001 # generate all random bigraphs with d = 1.001
   ./sbg_gen_abd -d 1.01  # generate all random bigraphs with d = 1.01
   ./sbg_gen_abd -d 1.1   # generate all random bigraphs with d = 1.1
   ./sbg_gen_abd -d 2     # generate all random bigraphs with d = 2
   ./sbg_gen_abd -d 0     # generate all random bigraphs with d = infinity
</pre>

Note: the exact same data can be regenerated in one of two ways: (a) save
the seed file before running the script and restore the saved seed file
before running the same script again, or (b) look at the dot file of the
first graph generated, in this case
<code>GB_1_rnd1_01/GB_1_rnd1_01_0001.dot</code>
in the data subdirectory, and create a seed file from the seed given in the
comment.

<p>
You can create a file that contains seeds for recreating each individual
data directory (for easy replication of results), by running the
<code>sbg_harvest_seeds</code> script. In this case, you would say
<pre>
   ./sbg_harvest_seeds 'GB_1_rnd*_0[1-5]' SEEDS
</pre>

<p>
Then run all the standard treatments on the classes just generated (only
tr03 and tr06 are needed, but it's easier and fairly quick
to do all). Go into
<code>scripts_execute</code> (<code>cd ../scripts_execute</code>) and run
<pre>
   ./sbg_run_all 'GB_1_rnd*_0[1-5]'
</pre>
All the execution scripts are silent (except for the output files produced
to summarize the results of each treatment) and this will take about half
an hour on a Sparc 5 Ultra (less on a newer machine).  See the description
of <a href="formats.html">naming conventions</a> to make sense of
<code>GB_1_rnd*_0[1-5]</code> ("balanced"
graphs with <var>a</var>=1, random with any dimension, ranks 1 to 5).

<p>
Collect and summarize the results by going into <code>scripts_evaluate</code>
(<code>cd ../scripts_evaluate</code>) and running
<pre>
   ./sbg_summaries 'GB_1_rnd*_0[1-5]' 
</pre>
This creates a <code>SUMMARY_&lt;class directory&gt;</code>
file for each random tree class in
the processed directory.
 
<p>
Finally, create the data table for the figure by running (also in
scripts_evaluate)
<pre>
   ./sbg_tree_ratios tr03 tr06
</pre>
to produce the file <code>GT_tr03_tr06</code>
in the <code>processed</code> directory. There will be
two error messages from fgrep because summary files for dimension infinity
(rnd0) were not generated by the earlier script.

First column of <code>processed/GT_tr03_tr06</code>
gives number of edges. The remaining
columns report the ratios between number of crossings for the two
treatments, each column representing a different tree type (the difference
is only in the dimension d).
