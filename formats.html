<h2 align=center>Stallmann, Brglez, Ghosh: Data Formats</h2>

<p>
The actual data used and generated to obtain the results reported in the
paper can be reconstructed using the random number seeds in the file
<a href="SEEDS_ISO"><code>SEEDS_ISO</code></a>
(for isomorphic classes) or <a href="SEEDS_RND"><code>SEEDS_RND</code></a>
(for random graph classes). Each line of these files has the name of a
class followed by the three 16-bit unsigned integers used to construct the
seed for the IEEE 48-bit random number generator (<code>rand48</code>
library).

<p>
The data directory (after the desired bigraph classes are generated or the
top-level directory in the other archive) contains a subdirectory for each
bigraph class. These subdirectories are named as follows (using the
organization of Table 2 in the paper). In all cases <var>k</var>
is a two-digit
encoding of the rank, padded with a 0 when needed.

<ul>
  <li> <code>GB_</code><var>a</var><code>_rnd0_</code><var>k</var>
		 - these are the directories for <var>R(a,m)</var>, where
		 <var>a</var>
		 is expressed in decimal notation, with the letter <code>p</code>
		 representing the decimal point, and <var>m</var> =
		 15 * 2<sup><var>k</var></sup> - 10.  

  <li> <code>GB_1_rnd</code><var>d</var><code>_</code><var>k</var>
		 - directories for <var>R(1,m,d)</var>, where <var>m</var> is based
		 on <var>k</var> as
		 with <code>GB_</code><var>a</var><code>_rnd0_</code><var>k</var>,
		 and <var>d</var> is the dimension in decimal with <code>p</code>
		 representing the decimal point.
</ul>

The notation <code>GB</code>
refers to the fact that these bigraphs are "balanced",
i.e. <var>b</var> = 1
(each layer has the same number of nodes, off by one if there's an
odd number). The "rnd0" really means "<var>d</var> = infinity"
(or, originally, "<var>d</var> is
not relevant").

<ul>
  <li> <code>G_r_</code><var>k</var> -
		 grid graphs <var>G<sub><code>r</code>,k</sub></var>

  <li> <code>G_b_</code><var>k</var> -
		 butterfly graphs <var>G<sub><code>b</code>,k</sub></var>

  <li> <code>G_h_</code><var>k</var> -
		 hypercubes <var>G<sub><code>h</code>,k</sub></var>

  <li> <code>G_</code><var>xy</var><code>_</code><var>k</var> -
		 VLSI graphs <var>G<sub>xy,k</sub></var>,
		 where <var>x</var> is 0, 1, or 2 (meaning
		 the density factor <var>a</var> is 1, 2, or 4), and <var>y</var>
		 is 0 or 1 (meaning "easy or "hard")

  <li> <code>G_</code><var>t</var><code>_rnd0_</code><var>k</var> -
		 <var>rnd(X)</var>, where <var>X</var> is of rank <var>k</var>
		 and type <var>t</var>, and <var>t</var> is one
		 of <code>b</code> (butterfly), <code>h</code> (hypercube),
		 <code>r</code> (grid), <code>0y</code> (VLSI
		 tree), <code>1y</code> (VLSI graph with <var>a</var>=2), or
		 <code>2y</code> (VLSI graph with
		 <var>a</var>=4); it does not make sense to distinguish between
		 "easy" and "hard" here.
</ul>

A class <var>iso(R)</var>, where <var>R</var> is a random class, is denoted
by adding <code>_scr</code> (for
"scrambled") as a suffix to the name of the directory for <code>R</code>.

<p>
Before any experiments are executed, each class directory with name
<var>C</var>
contains two files for each subject, one is <var>C_s</var><code>.dot</code>,
where <var>s</var> is the
subject sequence number, encoded in 4 digits padded with 0's, and the other
is <var>C_s</var><code>.dot.ORD</code>.
The first describes the bigraph itself; the second
describes the permutation of each layer.

<var>C_s</var><code>.dot</code> contains a description of the bigraph in
simplified dot format
(based on the paper by Gansner et al.; our parser can deal with more
general formats, but will ignore any nonessential information about the
geometry of nodes).

<h3>Dot format.</h3>

<p>
The expected format of our dot files is
<ul>
    <code>digraph</code> <var>graph_name</var> <code>{</code>
  <var>statement</var> <code>;</code> ... <var>statement</var> <code>; }</code>
</ul>
where each <var>statement</var> defines an edge
<ul>
    <var>layer0_node</var> <code>-&gt;</code> <var>layer1_node</var>
</ul>

<p>
The graph name and node names must be legal C identifiers (begin with an
alphabetic character, have any number of alphanumeric characters, and
underscore counts as an alphabetic character).  Arbitrary white space is
allowed between and within statements. Comments delimited by
<nobr><code>/* ... */</code></nobr>
count as white space.

<p>
Graphs generated by our programs always have a comment giving the three
short integers of the rand48 seed right after the graph name. The graph
name is usually the same as the file name (with the .dot extension).

<h3>Ord format.</h3>

An ord file contains a sequence of layer descriptions separated by white
space. Each layer description is of the form
<ul>
    <var>layer_number</var> <code>{</code>
   <var>node</var> ... <var>node</var> <code>}</code>
</ul>
where the <var>layer_number</var>
is an integer (0 or 1 in the case of bigraphs, but
the notation can be generalized to more than 2 layers) and <var>node</var>
is the
name of a node on the given layer. The current implementation requires that
all nodes of the layer be present in the list and occur exactly once. The
list specifies the left-to-right ordering of nodes on the given layer.

<p>
Anything between a <code>#</code> and the end of the line is interpreted as a
comment. Arbitrary white space and/or comments can occur before the
<code>{</code>,
between nodes, or on either side of a layer description.

<h3>Other data files.</h3>

<p>
The program that executes our treatments generates an ord file with name
    <var>graph_name</var><code>_tr</code><var>t</var><code>.ord</code>
where <var>t</var> is a 4-digit encoding of the treatment number. The execution
scripts delete this file after it is no longer needed, but they can be
edited to omit this step.

<p>
When a treatment is executed on subjects of a class, the execution scripts
create a file <code>TR</code><var>t</var> in the class directory, where
<var>t</var> is a 2-digit encoding
of the treatment number. The file has two columns (tab-separated), with
graph names in the first column, and number of crossings after the
treatment was applied in the second.

<p>
Summary files, created by the script <code>sbg_summary</code>,
and containing summary
information for a given class, have names of the form
   <code>SUMMARY_</code><var>class-directory</var>.
There are also files that record information about total time and number of
iterations, called <code>TIMING_SUMMARY_</code><var>class-directory</var>
and <code>ITR_SUMMARY_</code><var>class-directory</var>, respectively.

<p>
Files generated for comparison with the J&uuml;nger-Mutzel paper begin with
the prefix <code>GN_JM_</code>. This is followed by
<code>S_</code><var>size</var> for the sparse graphs, where <var>size</var>
is the number of nodes per layer, or <code>10_</code><var>density</var> for
10+10 graphs of increasing density. Similar graphs with prefix
<code>GC_JM_</code> are generated, as are most of our graphs, in such as
way as to ensure connectedness.

<p>
There are also a few classes with prefix <code>GN_</code> replacing the
usual <code>GB_</code> in the random classes. These, like the graphs used
in the J&uuml;nger-Mutzel paper, use a simpler
random-graph generation technique that does not ensure connectedness.
